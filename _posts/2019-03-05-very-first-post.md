Okay. I admit. 

I've been lazy for the past few months and putting little to no efforts in learning about data analysis/science.

After getting a job as a Math Tutor with my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics, I sort of stopped looking for a job. 
All I did was reading some articles and wathching some videos related to data science from time to time. 

Teaching math to K-12 students is also meaningful in a way but it's not really my career of interest.
I feel like I'm not utilizing my skills and knowledge learnt from univeristy enough, especially my programming skills.
I enjoyed some programming challenges from my computer science classes in univeresity. 
And it felt SO GOOD when my code works perfectly :) 
Also, tutoring job is not particularly intellectually challenging. 
I mean, sometimes I forgot some formulas and theorems, so had to look them up and remind myself, 
but other than that, it's not super challenging.

Actually, I've been interested in data science for a while.
I found machine learning and data visualization really intersesting, so I took some basic machine learning and data analysis courses before.
Currently I am really into data visualization. 
I certainly want to pursue a career in data analysis/science in some day.

In order to do so, I should stop procrastinating and start learning. 
While learning about data analaysis/science, I am planning to apply for entry level jobs.
Hopefully I can find a decent entry job soon to puruse my career of interest and to gain experiences and skills.

The purpose of this blog is to log my learning progress, thus to accelerate my overall learning process.
The overall goal is not about getting an entry-level job but becoming a professional in the field through learning and getting experiences.
